    <br /><br /><br />

The browser you use to surf the web not only allows you to see the cookies </span><span class="terms-font2 color"> that you have got but also allows you to control their use. You can control them by allowing them, deleting them individually or deleting all of them. You can also set your browser to </span><span class="terms-font2 color">not accept cookies altogether. If this option is selected, you should be aware that many websites will not function properly or at all. It may be possible to set your browser to not accept </span><span class="terms-font2 color">cookies and ask for your consent before each cookie is set on your device. This gives you control over what is set on your device, however, has the drawback of slowing down your </span><span class="terms-font2 color">browsing experience. There are different levels of control too. You are able to prevent just third party cookies from being deployed, effectively opting out of behavioral advertising, </span><span class="terms-font2 color">and some even allow you to block specific companies you do not wish to deploy a cookie, instead of selecting all companies. In order to manage your cookies, please select your browser </span><span class="terms-font2 color">from the list below and follow the instructions:</span>
